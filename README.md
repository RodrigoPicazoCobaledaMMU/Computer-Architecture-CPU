# Computer-Architecture-CPU
Computer Architecture Assignment, 75% grade - 72 CPU Simulation 78 Assembly.s

This was my personal favourite module during my first year thanks to it's interesting topics such as how ALUs work, writing machine code for the CPU and, aswell as other topics more so covered in the RISC-V part such as memory which has helped me further understand data structures like arrays in other programming languages like C.

The CPU Simulation Circuit is not as complete as I wished it was however I unfortunately ran out of time and couldn't finish displaying the values from the accumulator as hex to the tty.

## Dependencies
- Logisim Evolution
- RARS RISC-V Emulator
- Java
